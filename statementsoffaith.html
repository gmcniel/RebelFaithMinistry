<h1><u><b>Statements of Faith:</h1></u></b>
<ol>
    <li>Trinity. We affirm and believe that the trinity, or Godhead, is God the Father, God the Son (Jesus Christ) and God the Holy Spirit. All three are one in essense of godhood and are all equal to God as they are all God. God the Father represents being our Father, creator, judge, avenger and merciful. God the Son represents the love of God that wants to save and redeem us of our sins as we lack the ability to save ourselves and Jesus Christ came down to save us as God's ultimate sign of love. God the Holy Spirit is the Spirit of God and the presence of God.</li>
    <li>Hell. We affirm and believe that those whom choose apostacy forfeit their faith and forfeit their eternal salvation and are damned to Hell for eternity. Hell is a place of torture and a place where we are separated from God. We are told in scripture that those outside of Jesus Christ are outside the gates of Heaven and Hell awaits those that don't believe and awaits those whom have unrepentant hearts.</li>
