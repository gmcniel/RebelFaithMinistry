<h1><u><b>Statements of Faith:</h1></u></b>
<ol>
    <li>Trinity. We affirm and believe that the trinity, or Godhead, is God the Father, God the Son (Jesus Christ) and God the Holy Spirit. All three are one in essense of godhood and are all equal to God as they are all God. God the Father represents being our Father, creator, judge, avenger and merciful. God the Son represents the love of God that wants to save and redeem us of our sins as we lack the ability to save ourselves and Jesus Christ came down to save us as God's ultimate sign of love. God the Holy Spirit is the Spirit of God and the presence of God.</li>
    <li>Hell. We affirm and believe that those whom choose apostacy forfeit their faith and forfeit their eternal salvation and are damned to Hell for eternity. Hell is a place of torture and a place where we are separated from God by entering outer darkness where the soul cannot handle being away from God. In the end times, those that are presently in Hell will be thrown into the lake of fire with Satan and his demons, or properly known as fallen angels. We are told in scripture that those outside of Jesus Christ are outside the gates of Heaven and Hell awaits those that don't believe and awaits those whom have unrepentant hearts.</li>
    <li>Salvation. Salvation to eternal life is only possible through repentance with a sincere heart, accepting and believing that Jesus Christ is Lord and Savior and how he was raised from the dead after being crucified for our sins on the cross. Salvation is by faith in Jesus Christ and only possible through the grace of God. GRACE: God's Riches At Christ's Expense. Salvation is also trying our best to resist the temptations that are caused by the devil and his demonic minions.</li>
    <li>Eucharist, Communion or Lord's Supper. We believe that when a baptized Christian partakes in communion, they are consuming the body and blood of Jesus Christ and he is both physically present and spiritually present. Those that haven't accepted Jesus into their hearts and those that haven't been baptized cannot participate in communion.</li>
    <li>Baptism. Baptism is acceptable in both forms of pouring and immersion with 3 dunks or pours each. The first is in the name of the Father, then the Son and lastly, in the name of the Holy Spirit. When we are baptized, we are reborn and forgiven of our sins and start off with a clean slate. Necessary for salvation and to be saved.</li>
    <li>Biblical Authority. The Bible is the Word of God that was divinely written through humans from God and is the authoritative source for our beliefs. When studying the Bible, we must use caution and discernment to help know and learn the Bible. If it doesn't come from the Bible, it is not supported by scripture.</li>
    <li>Sex. God wanted us as humans to reproduce as He intended and that is by hetereosexual relations when being married to one man and one woman. Sex is a gift used to procreate for married couples only and outside of procreation, it is a very sinful act to where it is also demonic and paganistic. We are told repeatedly in scripture to be fruitful and multiply, granted that we are married and are faithful to our spouse.</li>
    <li>Marriage. Marriage is between one man and one woman. Homosexual relationships go against the Word of God and His plan for us. Marriage is a sacred thing where a man and woman become one in unity as God intended and also useful for bringing up a child. Marriage isn't just an earthly one, but also a spiritual one. If a divorce is to occur, it should be valid for abandonment, abuse, unfaithful spouses and for when the government is intervening in the marriage affairs by cutting off ties to one's income.</li>
    <li>Alcohol. Alcohol is to be consumed in moderation and that moderation is in amounts to where one cannot get drunk as being drunk is a sin. We are told the dangers of alcohol as it has destroyed various relationships and has harmed many.</li>
    <li>Ordination. We believe and affirm that ordination can only come from God and God alone. God does the calling and the ordaining. If God calls one to the priesthood, we are called to obey and to evangelize among each other and to the world. Those that are called are best to have a theologically sound mind and are able to preach and teach. Studying the Bible is a must and must be preaching sound doctrine that isn't too liberal and progressive as God's Word will never change.</li>
    <li>Sin. We affirm and believe that sin is an act of rebellion against God that is caused by Satan and his demons (fallen angels). We inherited the original sin from the fall of Adam and Eve in the Garden of Eden when Eve disobeyed Heavenly Father's instructions to refrain from eating from the tree of life. We are born as sinners and we will perish as sinners.</li>
    <li>Good Works. Good works are excellent and great to do to help those that need it, especially the less fortunate. Good works will not save us alone, but it will demonstrate the faith that we have in Jesus Christ.</li>
    <li>Purgatory. There is no purgatory as when someone passes away, immediate judgment awaits for either Hell or Heaven.</li>
    <li>Non-monogamous relationships. Non-monogamous realtionships violate God's law and creation of both sex and marriage between one man and one woman as it is an abomination to the Lord.</li>
    <li>Worldly Desires of The Flesh. We are to tame and calm the earthly and worldly desires of the flesh as flesh does not have our best interest at heart. God does have our best interest and He wants us to flee from mateialism and free from addictions and sins that would separate us from God. If we fail to do so and keep choosing our desires over God, Hell unfortunately awaits.</li>
